## Introduction
> Participation and submission for the 2021 Better Working World Data Challenge. 
Find out more about the fire edge detection challenge in this <a href= https://github.com/EY-Data-Science-Program/2021-Better-Working-World-Data-Challenge/wiki> github wiki </a> 

## Installation
Refer to the link above for a detailed installation instruction. 
Trust me, it takes a bit of effort to do. And you'll be working in a pre-loaded Open Data Cube Environment on a Microsot Azure VM. 
Be sure to take your time and enjoy the experience. 
You can also choose to use your local machine, but you'll need Docker and a lot of processing power. 

## File Description
There are 3 notebooks in the repo. One was created by <a href= https://www.ga.gov.au/dea> Digital Earth Australia </a> to describe the Basic Analysis steps involved when working with Satellite data (Geodataframes and linescans). The remaining 2 are step-by-step analysis followed to make a prediction of the boundaries of fire in a satellite linescan image. 

The `.csv` file contains the first prediction. 


## Result
`.csv` file contains the first result for Challenge 1. The accuracy of the prediction was found to be approximately `0.11`. I'm still exploring ways of improving this prediction accuracy.
